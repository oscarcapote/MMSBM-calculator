# Multipartite_MMSBM

Program that uses the Mix-Membership Stochastick Block Model using metadata as prior.

# Language
- Python >= 3.5

# Requirements
- pandas
- numpy
- numba
- PyYaml

# Configuration
When you want to perform an analysis, you have to create in the folder where the results will be stored a file named `config.yaml`. It has to be written in a yaml format with this structure:

```
folder: !!str Folder_directory

#Put {F} instead of the fold number
links:
    test: !!str formated_u{F}.test
    base: !!str formated_u{F}.base
    separator_base: !!str ยง
    separator_test: !!str \t
    rating_header: !!str rating

nodes:
    nodes_header: !!str userId
    nodes_meta:
    - metadata_id_1
    - metadata_id_2
    ...
    file: !!str formated_users_tmp2.dat
    K: !!int 10
    separator: !!str \t
    lambda_nodes: 0.01

items:
    items_meta:
    - metadata_id_1
    - metadata_id_2
    ...
    items_header: !!str movieId
    file: !!str formated_movies_tmp2.dat
    L: !!int 10
    separator: !!str \t
    lambda_items: 0.0
    Taus:
    - 10

seed: !!int 77777
N_fold: !!int 2

simulation:
    N_itt: !!int 3000
    N_measure: !!int 1
```
## `folder`
Directory where your dataset that you want to analyze is stored.

## `links`
Section where you have to put information about the file that contains the links:
- `test`: Filename of the test set file
- `base`: Filename of the base set file
- `separator_test` and `separator_base`: Separators of the test and base files (default `\t`)
- `rating_header`: Header of the rating column
If your filenames have a number referring to the fold, you can write `{F}` and the program will substitute it automatically for the fold number.
## `nodes`
Section where you put the information of your nodes metadata file
- `nodes_header`: Header of the nodes identification column
- `K`: Numbers of nodes groups
- `file`:Filename with nodes metadata's information
- `nodes_meta`: Vector with the name of all the  nodes' metadata headers'
- `separator`: Separators of the nodes' file (default `\t`)
- `lambda_items`: Intensity of nodes's priors

## `items`
Section where you put the information of your items metadata file
- `items_header`: Header of the items identification column
- `L`: Numbers of items groups
- `file`:Filename with items metadata's information
- `items_meta`: Vector with the name of all the  items' metadata headers'
- `separator`: Separators of the items' file (default `\t`)
- `lambda_items`: Intensity of items's priors
- `Taus`: Vector with the numbers of groups of items'

## `seed`
Integer with the seed that the algorithm will initialize the membership and probabilities matrices

## `simulation`
Information about the simulation procedure
- `N_itt` Number of iterationts
- `N_measure` Number of iterations of separation between convergence checking

# Files structure
To use the program you need, at less, the file that contains the links of the bipartite network that you want to infer. If you want to add metadata to the nodes or the items you need one file for each containing the information of each node/item. All files must be writed in columns. By default, the program reads the files using a tabulator (`\t`) as a separator. If you use another separator you can change it in the `config.yaml` file as detailed above. The information about nodes, items and metadata must be integers that starts from 0 and increase sequentially. Here an example of a file that contains links:

```
node_id item_id label_id
0   2   0
0   6   2
0   8   1
1   3   0
1   2   1
...

```
Note that the first row contains the headers that you can indicate in the `config.yaml`.

And here we have an example of metadata file.
```
item_id genre_id
0       2
1       2
2       3
3       0
4       4
5       0
6       0
7       0
8       1
9       4
10      4
11      1

```
# Use
To run the program you have to go to the directory where the `config.yaml` is and run the code.
